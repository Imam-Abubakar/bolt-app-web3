# A BOLT Web3 app
# Project Description
  This project was developed to function as a ride booking web platform for the BOLT App. This project is simply a demo and is not in anyway related to Bolt Technology OU. With this stated, the web app was implemented with web3 functionalities and a cryptocurrency payment system (Ethereum) was implemented.
  Ride selection option is available and limited location selector was also implemented. A trip fee calculator was setup so that the price of the rides being selected is based on the distance between the pickup location and the dropoff location.
  A database was created so as to store users information(Name randomization used), trip history for each users and available ride options.
  Best viewed on larger screens(laptops...)
